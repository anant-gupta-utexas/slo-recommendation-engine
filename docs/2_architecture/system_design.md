# System Design

## Problem Statement & Requirements
Articulate what system is being built and why. Reference the PRD and highlight key technical challenges.

## High-Level Architecture Overview
Include a system context diagram showing major components, external systems, and their interactions (the "30,000 foot view").

## System Components & Services
Detailed breakdown of each major component, service, or module (responsibilities, interfaces, overall fit).

## Data Architecture
    - Data Models: Core entities and relationships.
    - Data Flow: How data moves through the system.
    - Storage Strategy: Database choices, partitioning, caching layers.
## API Design
Key endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, versioning, interaction patterns.

## Technology Stack
Programming languages, frameworks, databases, services, infrastructure components, with rationale for each choice.

## Scalability & Performance
How the system handles growth, load balancing, caching, performance bottleneck mitigation.

## Security Architecture
Authentication/authorization, data protection, network security, compliance.

## Deployment Architecture
Infrastructure, environments (dev/staging/prod), CI/CD, monitoring, operations.

## Trade-offs & Alternatives
Summarize key architectural decisions, alternatives considered, and rationale. This section should be informed by and complementary to the detailed ADRs you create.

## Risks & Mitigation
Technical risks, dependencies, contingency plans.

## Future Considerations
Potential expansion, known limitations, how architecture supports future growth.
