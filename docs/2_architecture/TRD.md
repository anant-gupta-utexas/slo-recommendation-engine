# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the project, scope, and high-level technical approach. (Ensure this is readable by non-technical stakeholders).

## Business Context & Objectives
Reference the PRD, outline business goals, and detail how technical decisions will support business outcomes. Include any identifiable success metrics and KPIs.

## Functional Requirements
Provide a detailed technical translation of the business requirements found in the PRD, including user workflows, system behaviors, and feature specifications.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
    - **Performance Requirements:** Specify anticipated response times, throughput, concurrent users, and scalability targets.
    - **Security Requirements:** Detail authentication, authorization, data protection measures, and any compliance needs evident or implied.
    - **Reliability & Availability:** Define uptime targets, disaster recovery considerations, and fault tolerance mechanisms.
    - **Usability Requirements:** List browser support, accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG), and mobile responsiveness needs.

## System Constraints & Assumptions
Identify the existing technology stack (if inferable or stated), budget limitations (if mentioned), timeline constraints, regulatory requirements, and any third-party dependencies.

## Integration Requirements
Detail necessary integrations with external APIs, databases, services, and systems. Specify data exchange formats and authentication methods where possible.

## Data Requirements
Define preliminary data models, storage needs, backup requirements, data retention policies, and potential data migration considerations.

## Infrastructure & Environment Requirements
Outline the hosting environment, server specifications, network requirements, and requirements for development, staging, and production environments.

## Compliance & Regulatory Requirements
List any specific compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) that the technical implementation must adhere to, based on the PRD's context.

## Quality Assurance Requirements
Describe testing strategies, code coverage targets, automated testing requirements, and quality gates.

## Deployment & Operations Requirements
Detail CI/CD pipeline needs, monitoring requirements, logging strategies, alerting mechanisms, and maintenance procedures.

## Dependencies & Risks
List technical dependencies, potential blockers, risk mitigation strategies you foresee, and contingency plans.

## Success Criteria & Acceptance Criteria
Define measurable technical outcomes and specific criteria for considering requirements successfully implemented.
